Main page of website, practic.ly, in Portfolio form

The most obvious distortions with the sidebar seem to just involve widescreen desktop monitors.

TODO:

*Different fonts:
--Google Fonts
--Dancing & Ledger vs. Something more Round & Bubbly

*Links to pictures:
-- Using a jQuery Lighbox to showcase photo gallery.
-- Find better pictures for Portfolio section

TODO LATER:

*Typography/Font idea
*Blog
